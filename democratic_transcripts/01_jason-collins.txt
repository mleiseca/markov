Thank you. I will get you back for that one later. My dream was to play in the nba and live my authentic life as a proud gay man at the same time. [cheering] i was able to accomplish both of those goals because of the people who have supported me throughout my life. Before i came out, to the world on the cover of sports illustrate it, i cannot privately for the clinton family. I have known the family for almost 20 years. I knew that they would accept me for who i was and that they would help pay the past or others to do the same. -- pave the path for others to do the same. I'm grateful for their words of wisdom and their unconditional support. They knew that my sexual orientation may a difference in my ability to play basketball. [cheering] just as someone's gender makes no difference in his or her ability to meet our nation -- lead our nation. [cheering] hillary has defended the lgbtq community for years from cosponsoring the matthew shepard hate crime prevention act to helping pass the first ever u.n. Resolution on lgbtq human rights and to making sure that transgender individual passports could reflect a true gender. [cheering] as both an african-american and a member of the lgbtq community, the choice for continued progress is clear. We must elect hillary clinton as our next president. Thank you.

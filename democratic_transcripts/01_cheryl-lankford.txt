When you lose a spouse, you know your life will change forever. You know it will not be easy. But I did not expect that on top of grieving the loss of my husband and trying to take care of my baby, I would also be the victim of a scam. 

You just saw what happened to me. How trump university cheated me out of the money I received after my husband's death. How they broke promises, stopped taking my calls, how the whole thing was a lie. By conning me out of the money the military gave me after my husband died, I felt like Trump University was disrespecting Jonathon's memory. I was curious, frightened, and the truth is, I was embarrassed. 

The worst part, I was not the only victim of donald trump's greed. Far from it. He preyed on vulnerable people like military widows, and the elderly. He made millions of dollars off of people like me. He cheated more than 5000 students. Hard-working middle-class folks. Teachers, police officers, even veterans. These are folks just like me who did not have a lot. Who were told that if they pay for donald comes programs, they might be of to make it better living. 

Here is a guy who was born rich and has all the money in the world and there's nothing wrong with that. I signed up for trump university because I thought I could learn from been some him but then he decided to make himself even richer. By cheating working people who had nothing to spare. What kind of man does that? 

It is not easy for me to get up here and tell my story. For a long time, I did not tell anybody. But even my family or my friends. But I'm here because america deserves to know the truth. This election is not about democrat or republican. It is about right versus wrong. Someone who helps ordinary people no matter what it takes. Versus someone who helps himself, no matter who it hurts. Donald trump make big promises about trump university. I was fooled into believing him. Now he is making big promises about america. Please, don't make that same mistake.

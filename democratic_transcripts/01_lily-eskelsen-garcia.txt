Wow. [speaking spanish] i am here because i have the honor to be representing the 3 million educators that form the union of the national education association. My story is not different from my students story. My mom is an immigrant and my dad served in the army. My parents worked hard so their kids could have a chance to get ahead and they were so proud of me when i became a teacher. Today, too many students in our classrooms feel like they will not get the same chance i got, especially those from immigrant families. They tell us they are afraid that their parents might be taken away, that they might be deported for not having the right piece of paper. Hillary clinton believes in keeping families together. She believes in our dreamers. She believes that educators should be focused on education, not deportation. Donald trump sees things differently. My mom says if you cannot say something nice about somebody, it you should at least make it funny. I cannot make this funny. Donald trump sees immigrants as criminals, drug dealers ,rapists? He says he would round up families and up them and build a wall -- depart them and build the wall. We are better than that. Hillary clinton does not want to divide people with walls or hate. She wants to build bridges to a better future for all of us. That is why america's educators are with her and why we will do everything in our power to build a bridge to a future where hillary clinton is the president of the united states of america. Gracias.

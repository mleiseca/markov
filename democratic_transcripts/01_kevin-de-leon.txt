Thank you, tina, and thank you for what you do for the great state of oregon. Friends, i am senate president from the great state of california. I am with hillary because she has spent a lifetime fighting for families just like mine. As the son of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education, i know how important the work at the state capital can be. We open doors of opportunities to hard-working americans who do not have the luxury of a family inheritance or eighth agreed -- pedigreed name. Democrats in california have led the way by raising the minimum wage, expanding affordable childcare, establishing the dream act that keeps families together, keeping college affordable, and creating more than 500,000 clean energy jobs through our landmark climate laws. We have made unprecedented progress in every area and when we elect hillary clinton as the next president, i know our progress won't to be america's -- won't be america's progress. These other progressive policies -- this is how democrats govern and when democrats lead, everyone has a shot to succeed. Not by shouting bombastic rhetoric into the microphone, but by taking bold, intentional policies and implementing them and igniting innovation that leaves no one behind. That is how you improve the human condition. Democrats do not alienate, isolate, exclude, or demonize. And we do not manufacture fear. That is a sign of weakness. We look to solve inequality, in power the forgotten and overlooked and expand the winners circle for everyone irrespective of who you are, where you come from, the language you speak. We fight for equal pay for all women because we know that an economy works better when we all work together. Friends, we are all democrats. More importantly, we are americans. I got a message for donald j. Trump. [speaking spanish] we do not build walls here. We tear them down.

Thank you very much for coming here today. I really appreciate it. And today, I'm going to tell you a story about my parents about the deportation and immigration. 

I'm the daughter of immigrant parents. Valiente, brave. That is what hillary clinton called me when I told her I was worried my family would be deported. Even when I was little, my parents were always crying, but I did not know why. Soy americana. 

I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. My parents came here looking for a better life for the american dream. On most days, I'm scared. I'm scared that at any moment, my mom and my dad will be forced to leave and I wonder, what if I come home and find it empty? I want my parents to see me doing science experiments and help me find my rocks. I want to grow up to be a lawyer so I can help other families like us. 

I have hope. Esperanza. Hillary clinton told me she would do everything to could to help us. She told me that I don't have to do the worrying because she would do the worrying for me and all of us. She wants me to have the worries of an 11-year-old, not the weight of the world on my shoulders.

Sabemos que hillary luchara para nosotros y por el suenos americana. Hillary clinton for president. Thank you!

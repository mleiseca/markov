Thank you very much for coming here today. I really appreciate it. And today, i'm going to tell you a story about my parents about the deportation and immigration. On the daughter of immigrant parents. Valiente, brave. That is what hillary clinton called me when i told her i was worried my family would be deported. Even when i was little, my parents were always trying -- crying, but i did not know why. Soy americana. [cheering] i was born in las vegas, nevada. My parents came here looking for a better life for the american dream. On most days, i'm scared. I'm scared that at any moment, my mom and my dad will be forced to leave and i wonder, what if i come home and find it empty? I want to find -- i want my parents to see me doing science experiments and help me find my their rocks. I want to grow up to be a lawyer so i can help other families like us. [cheering] i have hope. Esperanza. Hillary clinton told me she would do everything to could to help us. She told me that i don't have to do the worrying because she would do the worrying for me and all of us. [cheering] she wants me to have the worries of an 11-year-old, not the weight of the world on my shoulders.
Sabemos que hillary luchara para nosotros y por el suenos americana. Hillary clinton for president. [cheering] thank you!

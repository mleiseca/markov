Hi, I’m Congresswoman Doris Matsui from the great state of California!
Today the success of women is more important than ever to the strength of working families.
Women are fueling the future of the American economy. That’s why House Democrats created the Economic Agenda.
When women succeed, America succeeds!
We have four keys to unlock the full potential of women and working families:
Fair pay – raising the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay for equal work;
Paid leave – empowering women and men to balance the responsibilities of work and family;
And affordable, quality child care.
And strengthen retirement security for women to enter their twilight years with confidence and with dignity. We will fight Republican attempts to weaken Social Security.
Hillary Clinton stands with us, and we stand with her on every one of these commitments.
Together, we will build a stronger America for our families.

Hello. For my 50th birthday i got a two-year-old. You see my daughter and my boyfriend -- her boyfriend had a dutiful boy. They got caught up in jugs. -- drugs. It started with pain medication she was given after francis was born. And it just got worse. It is hard to point just how devastating it is to watch her child struggle with substance abuse. I know my daughter loves francis, but love is not enough to take care of him. I started getting calls from child services and one day, grants us would be taken away from my family and put in foster care unless he had family who could take care of him. There was no way we were going to let our grandson and up in foster care. So francis lived with my husband john and i until he was five. He lives with his grandfather now on disability. When you are my age, you don't expect to start all over again raising a grandchild. Today, my daughter is in treatment but she has a long road ahead of her. My story is not unique. This epidemic has devastated communities all over the country , it does not discriminate against age, race, gender or income. It affects all of us. But sometimes it feels like folks in washington don't hear the stories. Last year, hillary clinton came to new hampshire for a roundtable at my workplace and she asked if addiction had touched any of us. As i told my story, hillary listened. She even took notes. And she did something else we don't see a lot of in washington, she took action. She came up with a plan, one that includes everything from reducing overdoses to expanding aspects student -- access to treatment. That is the kind of leader we need. We need a leader who listens to the voices of ordinary americans , a leader who treats people with compassion and respect. A leader who believes that as americans, we look out for each other. I'm not saying that leader has to be a grandmother, but it sure helps. For me, that leaders who are clinton. [cheering] -- leader is hillary clinton. [cheering]

My name is Lauren Manning and when I arrived at the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, I was a partner at Cantor Fitzgerald. I was a wife and a mother.
A moment later, I found myself in the midst of the worst peacetime attack in this nation’s history.
I was catastrophically burned over 82% of my body. My chances of survival next to zero.
I battled for months to live and for years to recover.
I fought in tribute to my friends and colleagues at Cantor Fitzgerald that I lost that day and all the 2,996 people who were killed.
I fought to honor our troops who were fighting and continue to fight on the front lines for each and every one of us around the world.
And I fought to return to my young son, 10 months old at the time.
I fought as hard as I could so that the terrorists would not get one more.
Hillary Clinton stood with me through that fight.
And in the darkest of days and in the hardest of times, the people who show up in your life are the ones that mean everything.
Hillary showed up. She walked into my hospital room and she took my bandaged hand into her own.
Our connection wasn’t between a senator and a constituent; it was person to person.
And as a woman working in business for years, I know you have to be tough and in that woman is a hell of a tough person.
For years she visited, called, and continues to check in because Hillary cares.
When I needed her, she was there.
When our first responders needed her, she was there.
When New York needed her, she was there.
I trusted her when my life was on the line and she came through, not for the cameras, not because anyone was watching but because that’s who she is – kind, caring, loyal. She had my back.
This is the Hillary Clinton I want you to know. She was there for me and that’s why I’m with her.
Thank you.

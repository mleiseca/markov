Hi, I am Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman and I come from the great state of New Jersey.
House Democrats believe that America is strongest when we have an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top.
If you are willing to work hard in our country, you deserve a secure financial future and a strong foothold on the American dream â€“ buying a home, sending children to college, and real retirement security.
We should be creating jobs by upgrading our roads, bridges, broadbands, transit systems, energy grids, and water infrastructures.
And we can pay for this progress by closing loopholes and making big corporations pay their fair share.
Democrats, led by Hillary Clinton, know that we must make college more affordable and lift the crushing burden of student debt that weighs on the futures of many young Americans and their families.
America is stronger when everyone has a chance to succeed.

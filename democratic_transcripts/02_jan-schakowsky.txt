Good evening. I’m Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. Thank you. From Illinois, the birthplace of Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton and House Democrats believe a stronger America means protecting women’s rights and expanding women’s opportunities.
Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have other priorities – meddling in women’s most intimate decisions, jeopardizing women’s health, even criminalizing women’s choices.
When it comes to the issues between women and their doctors, House Republicans misrepresent; they intimidate and they undermine. In this Congress alone, they have voted 14 times to attack women’s health.
Republicans continue to attack the Affordable Care Act, while it provides newfound health security to millions of Americans.
Because of health care reform, no longer can insurance companies charge you more just because you’re a woman. And for the first time in history, no longer is being a woman a pre-existing condition.
Democrats are fighting back against the Republican anti-woman crusade.
It’s 2016 and American women are not going back. We are moving forward!

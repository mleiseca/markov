Hi! I am Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez from the great state of New York!
America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs have always been at the heart of our economy and the true engine of job creation in our communities.
And today more women are starting small businesses than ever before. Women owned and women operated small businesses are the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in America today.
Women of color and women veterans are quickly transforming the face of entrepreneurship in our country.
Women entrepreneurs are building a stronger America every day. They need the capital to grow and the tools to thrive.
Hillary Clinton has a plan that will ensure all of America’s small businesses can compete and succeed in the global economy because Hillary sides with the little guy. That is why I am with her.

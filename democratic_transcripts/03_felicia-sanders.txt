Good evening.
My son’s last words were, ‘We mean you no harm.’
Tywanza. My hero.
Two days later, I forgave the shooter who murdered him.
Hate destroys those who harbor it. I refused to let hate destroy me.
Though I have to ask: How was he able to purchase a gun he used to kill so many?
After that fateful day, Hillary Clinton called on lawmakers to close the Charleston loophole.
Because of the loophole, even though the shooter had an arrest record, when it didn’t surface and three days passed, he could still buy that gun.
No one should feel what I’ve seen. No one should feel how we feel, how we’ve suffered.
The Bible tells us that if we humble ourselves, pray, and turn from our wicked ways, God will forgive us and heal our land.
Let us heed God’s word and in turn may God heal our nation.

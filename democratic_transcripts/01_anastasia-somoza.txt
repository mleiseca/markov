I first met hillary as first lady to the white house. I was nine years old and i listen to her as my mom discussed health care and early intervention for children with disabilities. [cheering] over the past 22 years, she has continued to serve as a friend and mentor. Championing inclusion and access to higher education and the workforce. [cheering] she has never lost touch with people like me. She believes in me and in a country where 56 million americans with disabilities so often feel invisible, hillary clinton sees me. [cheering] she sees me as a strong woman, professional and a hard worker and a proud daughter of immigrants. My father from nicaragua and my mother from ireland. [cheering] she has shown me that all these aspects of my identity our strengths which will help me affect change. [cheering] i fear the day when we elect a president who defines americans and the mayor was possible terms. -- narrowest possible terms. Donald trump has shown us who he really is and i honestly feel [indiscernible] i know we will show each other and the world who we really are in november when we choose genuine strength and thoughtful leadership over fear and division. [cheering] donald trump doesn't see me, he doesn't hear me and he definitely doesn't think for me. [cheering] i'm confident as president, hillary clinton will do everything in her power to promote the empowerment and humanity of all americans. [cheering] she knows that when we support education and implement opportunities for absolutely everyone, more of us will be able to live happy and productive lives. And contribute to this great country. [cheering] as president, hillary clinton will continue fighting and inspiring us all with her tireless effort on our behalf. [cheering] i'm proud to be with you hillary. Thank you for showing me how to live with a courageous heart.

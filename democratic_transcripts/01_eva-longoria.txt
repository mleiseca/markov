Hello Philadelphia! Oh man, I am so honored to be here tonight, and I am proud to say, I'm with her!

You know, like many of you, this election is very personal to me. I'm from a small town in South Texas and if you know your history, Texas used to be part of Mexico. Now, I'm 9th generation American. My family never crossed a border — the border crossed us. So when Donald Trump calls us criminals and rapists, he's insulting American families. My father is not a criminal or a rapist. In fact, he's a United States veteran.

When Trump cruelly mocked a disabled reporter, he was also mocking my special needs sister Lisa, and many like her. When he said that a wife who works is a very dangerous thing, he not only insulted me — he insulted my mother, who worked as a special education teacher for 30 years, raised four children while being a wife!

You know, I believe in the candidate who believes in all of us, and that candidate is Hillary Clinton. Hillary has spent her whole life fighting for all Americans, from healthcare reform to equal pay for women to gun safety to protecting the economy. She is the most qualified Presidential candidate ever! She's been fighting for us for decades and now it's time we fight for her.

Now I'm very proud to be part of that fight, and I'm very proud to be here to introduce my dear friend Cory Booker, but before I do, I want you to take a look at your convention, Philadelphia. A Latina from South Texas is introducing the first black Senator from New Jersey on the week we'll nominate our first woman candidate for President of the United States! Pretty great. So guess what, Donald? It turns out America is pretty great already. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Senator Cory Booker.

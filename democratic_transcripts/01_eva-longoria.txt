Hello philadelphia! I am so honored to be here tonight and i am proud to say i am with her. [applause] and cheers -- eva: like many of you, this election is very personal to me. I am from a small town in south texas. [cheers and applause] eva: if you know your history, texas used to be part of mexico. Now, i am not generation american. My family never crossed the border. The border crossed us. So, when donald trump calls us criminals and rapists he is insulting of families. My father is not a criminal or a rapist, in fact he is a united states veteran. [cheers and applause] eva: when trump cruelly mocked the disabled reporter he was also mocking my special needs sister at and many like her. When he said that a wife who works is a very dangerous thing, he not only insulted me he insulted my mother who worked as a special education teacher for 30 years, raised four children while being a wife. You know, i believe in me candidate who believes in all of us and that candidate is hillary clinton. [cheers and applause] the eva: hillary has spent her whole life fighting for all americans. From health-care reform to equal pay for women to gun safety to protecting the economy. She is the most qualified presidential candidate ever. [cheers and applause] even: she is been fighting for us for decades and now it is time we fight for her. Now, i am very proud to be part of that fight and i am very proud to be heard to introduce my dear friend cory booker. But, before i do i want you to take a look at your convention, philadelphia. A latina from south texas is introducing the first black senator from new jersey on the week we will nominate to our first female candidate for president of the united states. [cheers and applause] in eva: pretty great. So guess what donald, it turns out america is pretty great already. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome senator cory booker.

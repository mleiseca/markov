One of my first memories is standing outside our Richmond, Virginia polling place with my dad to hand out campaign literature in support of our chosen candidates – our chosen Republican candidates.
When it comes to campaigning, I have done it all – phone banked voters and knocked on so many doors. I bet a lot of you did the same.
One difference though – I campaigned exclusively for the GOP…until this election. 
I’ve voted Republican my entire life. I believe in the bedrock values of the Republican Party: liberty, equality, and the idea that there are individual rights that cannot be taken away. These are values to be proud of.
And because the Republican Party has abandoned those values this year, this Republican is voting for Hillary Clinton.
In Donald Trump’s America, it doesn’t matter what I’ve accomplished as an attorney and policy expert. All that matters is how attractive I am on a scale of one to ten.
Trump’s loathsome comments about women and our appearances are too many to list and too crass to repeat. They are too important to ignore though.
Trump can discount our accomplishments, he can disrespect our abilities, but come November he cannot disregard our votes!
There are some who will say I’m voting for Hillary Clinton because she’s a woman. People who say that dismiss my voice and Hillary’s long record of public service.
And I know there are some who are contemplating staying home this November. Your voice can help define the next chapter of American values, American policy, and American leadership around the world – for better or for worse.
I’m here tonight to ask all of you to join me to not only oppose Donald Trump, but to support Hillary Clinton because we’re not just Republicans and Democrats, we’re Americans.
Thank you.

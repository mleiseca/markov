Good evening. 

I am Tina Kotek the vice chair of the Democratic legislative campaign committee and speaker of the house from the great state of Oregon. 

Can we move the prompter a second? I will say that again. Thank you very much. 

As the first lesbian speaker of any state house in our nation. Thank you. I have personally witnessed the tremendous progress towards equality and justice for the LGBTQ community. We have come so far, and we cannot â€” we cannot go back. 

I am known for being someone who tells it like it is. And the fact is I am with Hillary because she is with me. 

Hillary Clinton understands that the work to improve the lives of everyday Americans does not just need to happen in Washington DC. It needs to happen in state capitals all across our country. 

Just like Hillary, Oregon Democrats and Democratic state legislators across the country are proud to stand up for the hard working people we represent. 

We have been leading the country by advancing progressive policies that level the playing field and create an economy that works for all Americans. From raising them whene minimum wage to guaranteeing paid family medical leave, to ending racial profiling, Democratic leaders in the states are fighting to get it done. 

And now we need to elect Hillary Clinton to ensure the progress we are making is not compromised by risky, reckless leadership in the oval office. From the statehouse to the White House, we need leaders like Hillary Clinton who will stand up to the bullies who threaten fairness and equality, who offer real solutions to put working families first, and built an economy that gives everyone a fair shot at success. 

Hillary Clinton is our answer to intolerance and fear. And I have her back because I know she stands with all of us. Thank you very much.

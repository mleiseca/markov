Pray with me. 

Awesome and wonderful God of the universe, you are the one who created the world and all who live in it. You are the God of a nation, each one old in existence to you. 

You made America the great nation it is, filled with gifted and enterprising people. We have the ability to create leadership for the world and all other nations, while at the same time operating as one nation under your name, with liberty and justice for all. 

Through our own human error, we have fallen short of your expectations instead of operating as United States and a united people, we have become divided. 

We have allowed our diversity to cause us to devalue and distrust, and mistreat one another. We have permitted our privilege to allow us to think we are superior to others, particularly the least of these among us. 

There is tension and dissension in the land. This is not your will for us and we know it. 

As we gather in Philadelphia this week at the Democratic national convention, we understand all you have entrusted to us and expect of us. We have a responsibility to you to be a party that celebrates diversity, values all people and treats everyone with dignity and respect. 

We have a platform that seeks to address the ills of our nation, right the wrongs, and help us be a just and equitable society. 

We have an opportunity, oh God, to give undeniable evidence of our commitment to justice and equality. By nominating Hillary Rodham Clinton as our candidate. Hallelujah. As our candidate for the highest office in the land. 

God, you have given us wisdom. Now give us courage for the facing of this hour. Unite us, oh God, in one party. It is in your mighty name that we pray. Amen.

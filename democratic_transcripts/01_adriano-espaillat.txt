Thank you. Hello, Democrats. Any Democrat in the house? Hello, New York. I am a Senator, and when I take my oath of office as your Congressman in january, I will become the first in the Dominican-American to ever serve in the US Congress. 

Perhaps just as important, I will be the first member of Congress who was once undocumented as an immigrant. You take that, Donald Trump. 

For us immigrants, our commitment to this country is not always found in our papers, in our documents. 

Even in our worst days, that tall elegant lady sits in New York harbor, and she says to Donald Trump every day, give me your tired, give me your poor, your huddled masses waiting to be free. 

With every callous in our hands the fruits that we plant are elements of our work. The skyscrapers that we build and the adopted soil that we choose to defend with every callous in our hands we build the bridges between our dreams and our destiny. 

For Donald Trump, that is scary. For Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, it is inspiring. So let's keep building. Let's keep dreaming. And let's elect Hillary Clinton as our next President so we can be stronger together.

Thank you.

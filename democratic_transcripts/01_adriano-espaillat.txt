Thank you. Hello, democrats. Any democrat in the house? Hello, new york. I am a senator, and when i take my oath of office as your congressman in january, i will become the first in the can-american to ever serve in the u.s. Congress -- dominican-american to ever serve in the u.s. Congress. Perhaps just as important, i will be the firtst member of congress who was once undocumented as an immigrant. You take that, donald trump. For us immigrants, our commitment to this country is not always found in our papers, in our documents. Even in our worst days, that tall elegant lady sits in new york harbor, and she says to donald trump every day, give me your tired, give me your poor, your masses waiting to be free. With every callous in our hands the fruits that we plant are elements of our work. The skyscrapers that we don't and the -- that we build -- between our dreams and destiny. For donald trump, that is scary. For hillary clinton and tim kaine, it is inspiring. So let's keep building. Let's keep dreaming. And let's elect hillary clinton as our next president so we can be stronger together. [speaking in spanish] mr. Espaillat: and donald trump -- [speaking in spanish] mr. Espaillat: thank you.

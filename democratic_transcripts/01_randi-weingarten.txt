Brothers and sisters. I'm proud to be here representing the 1.6 million members of the of the ast. -- aft.last week we saw a festival of fear. Every day was full of hate. Why? To hide that trumps plan like many of his businesses are completely bankrupt. Donald made millions while he ripped off workers and small businesses with his unfair business practices. Remember, he ended up bankrupting not one, not two, not three, but for of his companies -- but four of his companies. And his economic ideas will make millionaires like him richer at the expense of the middle class. Just look at trump university to see how he operates. Salespeople were told to exploit people's fears. And i quote, a single parent that may need money for food into useless high cost seminars. Instead of an education, students lost thousands of dollars and got nothing in return. That is trump in a nutshell. Manipulating people's fears to enrich himself. He is completely unqualified to be in the oval office. [cheering] thankfully, we have a different choice and it is a great one. Hillary clinton. [cheering] she has worked her entire life to level the playing field for working families. That's us of public education from pre-k to college. A plan for universal early childhood education. She will read set education policies that focus on creating creativity and critical thinking, not too much testing. [cheering] and she will make public universities free for working families. A stark contrast from donald trump's for profit scam. Heller is the most qualified candidate -- hillary is the most qualified candidate to run in my lifetime. The toys could not be clear. We must elect hillary clinton and tim kaine. Thank you very much.

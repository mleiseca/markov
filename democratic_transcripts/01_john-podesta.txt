Hello, Democrats. I want to begin by saying thank you to all of you across the country who have volunteered your time, donated what you could, signed up at HillaryClinton.com. You have voted to make Hillary Clinton the nominee of the Democratic party and this is your victory. 
To everyone who supported Senator Sanders, this is your victory, too. I have known Bernie since I was a young staffer and he was mayor of Burlington. He stood up to the special interests and fought to give working people a fair shake. 

Donald Trump has different values. He built his career by ripping people off, skipping out on his bills through bankruptcy. He is dangerous and divisive to trust to the White House. 

I am a fortunate grandson of Italian immigrants with a blue-collar dad and a pink-collar mom. I am working to elect a President who has the experience, vision to make progress in these turbulent times. That person is Hillary Clinton. 

Hillary will be a President who will take on powerful special-interests to make sure our economy works for everyone. She will be a champion for our children and families. With your hard work, we can build a better future for everyone. Farm families and military families, the forgotten middle class, and those who have been left out and left behind, and immigrants, people like my family and yours who struggled to get here who built this country and who love America. 

That is who we are fighting for and that what the election is about and that is why she picked Tim Kaine as a running mate. We will succeed in making history and elect the first woman President of the United States. Thank you.

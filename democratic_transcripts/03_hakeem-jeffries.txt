I’m Hakeem Jeffries from the great state of New York!
We are here today, standing on the shoulders of giants. Like Shirley Chisholm, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Barbara Jordan, Charlie Rangel, and so many others who made it possible for a kid like me to serve in the United States Congress.
In November the American People face a clear choice between the most qualified person ever to seek the presidency and the least qualified person ever to seek the presidency.
It’s a choice between a commander in chief and a bankrupter in chief.
It’s a choice between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Hate.
Donald Trump is a bounced check, but Hillary Clinton is money in the bank.
She believes that America is a better place today because of the presidency of Barack Obama.
She believes we should provide for the poor, work for working families, make sense for the middle class, and stand up for senior citizens.
She believes we should innovate in the inner cities, strengthen suburban communities, and revitalize rural America.
She believes we should increase economic opportunity, end the era or mass incarceration, and eradicate police brutality once and for all.
And she believes that whether you’re black or white, Latino or Asian, Jewish or Muslim, Catholic or Protestant, gay or straight, young or old that in this great country, every single American deserves equal protection under the law.
And that’s why together we’re going to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton as the next president of the United States of America.
God bless you.

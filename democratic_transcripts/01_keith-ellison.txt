How are you doing, democrats? [cheering] tonight, but democrats, we are united around the most progressive platform in history. [cheering] the most pro--- progressive platform in history. 50 going our minimum wage. Banning private prisons. Expanding social security. The public option. And debt free college tuition. [cheering] that is the platform that bernie sanders and hillary clinton wrote together. [cheering] and that is the platform that we can make the law of the land if we stand together, if we work together and if we vote together on november 8. [cheering] you know, trump, he wants to divide and conquer us with his anti-muslim, anti-mexican, anti-worker message. They don't want us to vote. They want to push voter id laws that block black and latino voters. Paul ryan want even allow a vote to restore voting rights act. We must push back. Voting is not -- not voting is not a protest, it is a surrender. [cheering] when they bring the fear, we bring the kurds. When they bring the division, we bring the unity. [cheering] as a proud, and that's a proud bernie sanders supporter, -- [cheering] i will always remember feeling the bern in minnesota. [cheering] there are my minnesotans over there. 6000 in the. 14,000, st. Paul. Bernie started the beginning of a revolution. [cheering] he packed them in from davenport to detroit. Yorktown -- your town to my. 13 million americans voted for progressive dies and millions more made an investment in building that movement $27 at a time. [cheering] together, together we call for justice. We call for racial justice. We call for wage justice. [cheering] and you know what, we made our voices heard. And together, democrats, we will make our voices heard in november when we defeat donald trump. [cheering] and elect hillary rodham clinton to the next president of the united states of america. [cheering] tonight, let us raise our voices and gratitude to the man who has helped make this great party greater than ever. Ladies and gentlemen, i give you bernie sanders!

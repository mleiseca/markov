How are you doing, democrats? 

Tonight, Democrats, we are united around the most progressive platform in history. 50 going our minimum wage. Banning private prisons. Expanding social security. The public option. And debt free college tuition. 

That is the platform that bernie sanders and hillary clinton wrote together. And that is the platform that we can make the law of the land if we stand together, if we work together and if we vote together on november 8. You know, trump, he wants to divide and conquer us with his anti-Muslim, anti-Mexican, anti-worker message. They don't want us to vote. They want to push voter id laws that block black and latino voters. Paul ryan want even allow a vote to restore voting rights act. We must push back. Voting is not a protest, it is a surrender. 

When they bring the fear, we bring courage. When they bring the division, we bring the unity. As a proud bernie sanders supporter, I will always remember feeling the bern in minnesota. There are my Minnesotans over there. Bernie started the beginning of a revolution. He packed them in from Davenport to Detroit. 13 million americans voted for progressive ideas and millions more made an investment in building that movement $27 at a time. 

Together, together we call for justice. We call for racial justice. We call for wage justice. And you know what, we made our voices heard. And together, democrats, we will make our voices heard in november when we defeat donald trump. And elect hillary rodham clinton to the next president of the united states of america. Tonight, let us raise our voices and gratitude to the man who has helped make this great party greater than ever. Ladies and gentlemen, i give you bernie sanders!

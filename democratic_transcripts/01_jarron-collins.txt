Thank you. I'm sure collins. Alongside my kind and brilliant wife elsa. We have three children that are raised here in america. I want my kids to know that anything is possible here. I want them to know that any more than a star athlete, president of the united states is a role model to millions of children. When it comes to donald trump, how do you tell your kids not to be a bully that the president is one? [cheering] how do you tell your kids to respect their heritage if their president disparages them. How do you tell your daughter if they are empowered if their president reduces women to their physical of. ? My parents, my family, and all the great coaches i've had in my life have taught me the importance of working hard, playing fair and most important, the ability to lead and bring people together to college great things -- accomplish great things. That sounds like hillary clinton to me. [cheering] it is with great pride that introduced the first public like a athlete to play in any of the four major american sports, my less handsome twin brother, jason collins.

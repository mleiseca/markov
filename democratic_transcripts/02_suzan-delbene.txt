Suzan DelBene from the great state of Washington!
Before coming to Congress, I was an entrepreneur and I know that innovation is at the heart of who we are as Americans and it’s essential to keeping American workers, American products, and American ideas number one in the 21st century.
A decade ago, House Democrats enacted the first innovation agenda, and with the majority, we made revolutionary investments in clean energy development and affordable world-class STEM education and expanding broadband to rural families.
And House Democrats will work with President Hillary Clinton to sustain America’s lead in innovation, creating good paying jobs, powering our economy, and driving bold solutions to the challenges facing our climate and our communities.
A strong America – an America that’s stronger together – will lead the world in entrepreneurship and innovation and clean energy.

Welcome to my district, and welcome to Philadelphia, the city that has made America free to date makes street again. â€” makes history again. 

This is the home of the liberty, but independence and liberty have never been given. We have to fight and defend these principles each generation. That has been the work of the brave men and women of the Armed Services. 

To all of you who have loved ones serving, thank you. To all who have defended our freedom but never came home, those missing in action, we remembered you. You are not forgotten. 

As Americans living in freedom, each of us has a responsibility to always remember the sacrifices of those that did not come home and those whose safe return we're still waiting for. We hold them in our hearts every single day. 

Across this great land and throughout greater Philadelphia, in venues from city halls to sports arenas, an empty chair honors our missing heroes. I was proud to pass along and place one such a chair in the United States Capitol forever, and in this Democratic convention, and we also saved them a seat. 

An empty chair that  will serve as a reminder of those members and those p.o.w.'s and what they did for our country. A reminder that we all have a responsibility to remember. 

Please talk to the pennsylvania delegation where we keep this memorial, the POW MIA national chair of honor right here in the pennsylvania delegation. Now I ask all of you to stand and observe a moment of silence for POW MIA Americans. Please stand. 

Thank you, and thank you for honoring our great community. Let's give them one more round of applause, to our veterans. Let's go New York. I can't hear you. How about pennsylvania? Let's break it up for our veterans. 

Thank you for all you do, and to keep Donald Trump out of the White House, someone who disrespects our POWs like john mccain, and do all we can do to our next President, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you.

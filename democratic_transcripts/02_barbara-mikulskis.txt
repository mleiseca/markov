<p>Fellow Democrats and sister Democrats and a special hello to the state of Maryland! </p>
<p>Our nation was born here in Philadelphia 240 years ago. </p>
<p>Our founding fathers gave us the great start, but it was the founding mothers who said, &#8220;Do not forget the ladies for we will ferment our revolution.&#8221; </p>
<p>They started the job, but we&#8217;re going to keep it going. </p>
<p>Now, yes, we do break barriers. I broke a barrier when I became the first Democratic woman elected in the Senate in her own right and the first to chair the powerful Appropriations Committee. </p>
<p>So, it is with a full heart that I&#8217;m here today as we nominate Hillary Clinton to be the first woman president. </p>
<p>Many of you have broken barriers. You were the first to go to college. You were the first to start a business. Maybe the first to be a citizen. </p>
<p>But when you know when you broke a barrier, you didn&#8217;t do it for yourself. You did it for so others who would not have barriers, only opportunities. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Hillary wants to do. </p>
<p>She wants to break your barriers to opportunities so you won&#8217;t have barriers. </p>
<p>You can count on her. She will work for you. </p>
<p>Some people want your rent, but Hillary wants to get results. She&#8217;ll fight for your day to day needs and the long range needs of the country. </p>
<p>Sheâ€™ll fight for the macro issues and those macaroni and cheese issues. So, you&#8217;ll have national security and economic security. </p>
<p>So you&#8217;ll have an opportunity for a good job and a good neighborhood with a good school, and your kids will have a really good future. </p>
<p>So you will have equal pay for equal work. Living wages. </p>
<p>So for healthcare when you need it. </p>
<p>So, yes, it&#8217;s about the new jobs and solar energy, but it&#8217;s so much &#8211; she wants that job to light up your home, light up your community, light up your life. And she wants that little light in you just to shine. </p>
<p>I know that Hillary listens. The Hillary I work with is duty-driven, unflagging and unflinching. </p>
<p>She&#8217;s a leader, so on behalf of all the women who&#8217;ve broken down barriers for others and with an eye towards the barriers ahead, I proudly praise Hillary Clinton&#8217;s name in nomination to be the next president.</p>

Al, get out of my frame. As some of you know i support bernie sanders and the movement behind him. [cheering] and ernie has already succeeded in so many ways. He has proved that citizens united is in fact not a necessary evil and by the way, citizens united, is it that such a beautiful name for something that means billionaires wind politicians -- buying politicians? Rails against our democracy. I'm very glad that hillary has bowed to overturn it. [cheering] not only did bernie wake us up, he made us understand what is possible and what we deserve. My shrink says we don't get what we want, we get what we think we deserve and bernie showed us that all of america citizens deserve quality health care and education, not just the wealthy elites. [cheering] i know, it's sounds so obvious. Who would not agree with it? I happen to believe the crazy notion that people who may be not have borne with the same opportunities should be given the same opportunities as you and me. [cheering] and all it takes to accomplish this is everyone, all of us, or as a pretty kick as woman said, it takes a village. [cheering] this democratic primary was exemplary. No name calling no comments about the size of candidates hands or how much they sweat or if they go to the bathroom, inside secret, they do. [cheering] that is for third graders. Come on. It is like major arrested development stuff. I'm still emotionally four and calling people names from my gold encrusted sandbox because i was given money. [cheering] i digress. Hillary heard the passion of the people, the people behind bernie and brought those passions into the party's platform and that is the process of democracy at its very best. And it is very cool to see. [cheering] hillary is our democratic nominee and i will probably vote for her. [cheering] it is so inspiring, so inspiring. Just a few years ago, she was a secretary and now she is going to be president. [cheering] she is like the only person ever to be overqualified for a job as the president. [cheering] i tell you this, i will vote for hillary with gusto. [cheering] as i continued to be inspired and moved to action by the ideals set forth by bernie who whenever stop fighting for us. -- will never stop fighting for us. I'm proud to be a part of birdies movement and a vital part of that movement is making absolutely sure that hillary clinton is our next president of the united states.

Welcome to the nation's birthplace, my hometown, Philadelphia. Right here in the sweltering summer of 17 776 a nation was conceived out of a shared commitment to powerful ideals that would inspire the world over. Father came to america when he was 19. He came here to enjoy the same rights and pursue the same opportunities that our founders dreamed of two centuries ago. He knew in this country is children would be considered trusts of americans as the descendants of the mayflower. My father is a janitor, cleaning the same train station many of us rode past to get here tonight. My mother was a school crossing guard. My brother and i grew up in a small row home where we were raised to believe in this country if you work hard, where you come from does not determine where you are going. Thanks to the many sacrifices, a lot of student loans, and a little luck, i became the first in my family to go to college. As democrats, our mission is to make more stories like mine more common, not less so. But all Donald trump wants to do is tell you who is to blame, to fan the flames of anxiety, and to exploit them in the most negative, divisive, dangerous ways. This is why hillary clinton's vision is so important. It is the opportunity for wages that help americans join the middle class and stay there, a plan to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work , a pathway to college, and a ladder into the working world. Now, Donald trump says the american dream is dead. Why does he want to lead america when he does not even believe in america? Donald trump is wrong. This is a remarkable country. By geography and by destiny, we are a land set apart. We democrats come to philadelphia this week to rio form -- reaffirm our commenced our founding ideals. We come here to renew our fight to make the american team in reality for all. We come here to elect hillary clinton the next president of the united states.

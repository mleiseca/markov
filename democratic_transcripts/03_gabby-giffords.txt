Hello, fellow Democrats! What a crowd!
I’m honored to be here today. We have important work ahead of us – work that will determine the future of our country.
Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? I’m ready.
In Congress, I learned a powerful lesson – strong women get things done.
Hillary is tough. Hillary is courageous. She will fight to make our families safer.
In the White House, she will stand up to the gun lobby. That’s why I’m voting for Hillary.
Speaking is difficult for me. But come January, I want to say these two words: “Madam President”!
Thank you very much!

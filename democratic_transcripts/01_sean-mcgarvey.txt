Good evening. I'm proud to be here in my hometown of philadelphia. And i'm even prouder to represent the 3 million members of the North American building trade unions. 

Trade union members have helped build this great nation. The Hoover Dam, the golding gate bridge, the freedom towers, the very arean we are in tonight. You name it, we build it. 

We are proud of our work. But with collapsed bridges, crumbling roads and stressed energy systems, we know it's past time to rebuild our nation's infrastructure. Building trade members are ready to do their part. 

Hillary clinton has the boldest infrastructure plan we have seen in generations. She will help us repair roads and bridges and make broadband universal. Build new airports and modernize the energy grid. She will do it all while creating good, fair paying jobs with standards that support real apprenticeship programs which the building trades pioneer. So workers get the skills they need to succeed. 

Let me be very clear, we cannot rebuild america unless we treat american workers with respect. 

donald trump chose a running mate that does not respect workers. As governor, mike pence gave corporations license to pay construction workers less by repealing the prevailing wage law that has been in place for eighty years. That was a bad deal for indiana and a bad deal for america. 

That is why hardhats, all across america support hillary clinton, and honorary ironworker tim kaine. 

They have our backs and we have theirs. Let's get to work and get them elected.

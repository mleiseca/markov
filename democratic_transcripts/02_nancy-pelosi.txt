Good evening! Good evening everyone!
In 1776, not very far from here, our founding fathers created our nation.
96 years after America’s women first won the right to vote – 96 years ago – we are preparing to shatter the highest, strongest marble ceiling in our country by electing Hillary Clinton president of the United States.
Aren’t you proud to be part of this historic moment in our history?
Hillary Clinton knows that this moment is not just about one woman’s achievement but about what a woman president will mean for the dreams and hopes and aspirations of every woman and every son and every daughter across the land for generations to come.
The Democratic women of the House are leading the way to unleash the power of America’s women and working families in our economy, in our society, and in our democracy.
Nothing is more wholesome for America than the increased participation and leadership of women in government and politics.
Here tonight are women leaders who personify the integrity, imagination, and idealism, and indeed the courage that will build a stronger America for hard working families.
As Hillary Clinton did, they have spent their lifetimes fighting for women and children.
And in November, we will affirm that great truth of our country: When women succeed, America succeeds!

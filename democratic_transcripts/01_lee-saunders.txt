Good evening. I am proud to be here representing the 1.6 million public service workers. We keep our committee safe and strong -- our community safe and strong, plowing roads and answering 911 calls. Every day in every way, we families -- we never quit putting families first. Hillary clinton never quits either. She understands that collective bargaining rights strengthen all of us. We need a president who gets that and understand that busting unions and cutting services means families suffer. Look at flint, michigan, is policies led directly to present drinking water -- where poisonous policies led directly to presoisoned drinking water. I was in las vegas at the trump hotel last week and they voted to form a union. But donald trump will not meet with them. It is no surprise, i guess. How can you be a strong worker when you are famous for the catchphrase, you are fired? This is not reality television. This is reality. We need a serious minded leader who puts families first. Not a thin-skinned bully who puts himself first. Unstoppable champion versus an unstable charlatan. I know what side i am on. I am with her. Elect hillary clinton the next president of the united states.

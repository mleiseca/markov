Good evening. I am proud to be here representing the 1.6 million public service workers. 

We keep our community safe and strong, plowing roads and answering 911 calls. Every day in every way, we never quit putting families first. 

Hillary clinton never quits either. She understands that collective bargaining rights strengthen all of us. We need a president who gets that and understands that busting unions and cutting services means families suffer. 

Look at flint, michigan, where poisonous policies led directly to poisoned drinking water. 

I was in Las Vegas at the trump hotel last week and they voted to form a union. But donald trump will not meet with them. It is no surprise, I guess. How can you be a strong worker when you are famous for the catchphrase, you are fired? This is not reality television. This is reality. 

We need a serious minded leader who puts families first. Not a thin-skinned bully who puts himself first. Unstoppable champion versus an unstable charlatan. I know what side I am on. I am with her. Elect hillary clinton the next president of the united states.

Like millions of americans, i'm living with mental illness. But i'm lucky, i have the resources and support to get treatment at a top facility. Unfortunately, too many americans from all walks of life don't get help. Either because they fear the stigma or cannot afford treatment. Untreated mental illness can lead to devastating consequences, including suicide, substance abuse and long-term medical issues. We can do better. Everyone of us can make a difference. By getting educated on this epidemic and his frightening statistics and by breaking the stigma, i urge every politician to support laws that will provide access to better health care and support for everyone. [cheering] this is not about politics, it is simply the right thing to do. I'm doing my very small part by having the treatment center that saw mr. My recovery on tour with me so that at least a soccer but people, even for a brief moment can have the same support that i received. It may not be a lot, but we have to believe every small action counts. I stand here today as proof that you can live a normal and empowered life with mental illness. I'm proud to support a presidential candidate will fight to ensure all people living with mental health conditions get the care they need to lead civilian lives. That candidate is hillary clinton. [cheering] let's make her the next president of the united states of america.

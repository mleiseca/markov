Thank you. Thank you thank you. [cheering] my first day of law school, my very first class, the goal escape unscathed. Not three seconds in, and i get the first question. Mr. Kennedy, what is the definition of a subset? Uhh. You realize it is the first word in your reading? Yeah. I circled it coveted not know what it meant. -- because i did not know what it meant. Do you have a dictionary? That is what people do when they don't know what a word means. I never showed up unprepared for professor elizabeth warren ever again. [cheering] she was the toughest teacher on campus but the wait list for her class was a mile long. She pushed us hard, she brought out our best and she believed in us and she believed in the law. Not as an abstraction, but as a living force with the power to make life better or worse. She taught us in the society for wages had not budged in 40 years. Where 2.5 milling children are homeless. Where we can expect one in three black men to go to prison. Our laws have human consequences. That fueled a logical professor to take on this country's most entrenched financial interest. Brought middle class champion back to a message to -- massachusetts senator. And it let a first-term senator become our government that check. A sea of power and privilege, and anchor for the voiceless and the demise. She asks more from all those because she believes deeply in each of us. That faith in our country and the american people is the very foundation of our credit party. -- democratic already. It echoes through the arena tonight and every classroom, living room, that senator warren has ever touched. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce to you, your senator, my senator, our senator senator elizabeth warren.

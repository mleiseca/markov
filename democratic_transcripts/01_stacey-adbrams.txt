I am stacy abrams and i join you today from the great state of georgia. I am honored to lead the democrats in the house of representatives. Growing up as the daughter of a librarian and a shipyard worker in southern mississippi, my family was hit by the economic insecurity that is too often driven by racism, sexism, and the ills that come from being born in the wrong zip code. My parents taught all six of their children, celebrate through service the great that is america. To understand that no matter how little we may have had, there was always someone with less and it was our job to serve that person, to know that even the most powerful among us, the strongest among us did not rise up alone. No matter where we start, we all need help. We all need opportunity. When we succeed, with us for together -- we prosper together. It changes the lives of our families, communities, our country. Hillary clinton understands that government at all levels is a found expression -- profound expression of our common humanity and shared values, of our aspirations, not our fears. That is why i am so very proud to stand with this remarkable woman with a thousand fellow state legislators and each of you as we elect hillary to be the 46th president of these united states. I am here today as part of a new american majority, one that has the courage to work together rather than tear our nation apart. We are the architects of solution to help families raise healthy children and make a living wage weather than crippling our economic future -- rather than crippling our economic future. We fight for more because that is who we are. The democratic party is the party of civil rights and human rights, we will always be the party of progress and inclusion and we will not allow the country to return to an era of discrimination. We will elect hillary clinton, a leader who sees the future and races toward it fearless and bold because america is and will always be stronger together. Thank you.

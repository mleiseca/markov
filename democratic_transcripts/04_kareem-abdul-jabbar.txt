Hello, everyone. I’m Michael Jordan and I’m here with Hillary!
I said that because I know that Donald Trump couldn’t tell the difference.
Good evening, everyone. I’m Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and I’m here to tell you about Captain Humayun Khan, who was one of 14 American Muslim soldiers who have died in combat serving the United States since 9/11.
His family immigrated to the United States from the United Arab Emirates, where Capt. Khan was born.
The first place they visited upon arriving in America was the Jefferson Memorial.
The words engraved there read: “I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.”
Donald Trump’s idea to register Muslims and prevent them from entering our country is the very tyranny Jefferson abhorred.
In 1777, Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which later became a model for the First Amendment.
Today’s so-called “religious freedom” acts, like the one signed by Gov. Mike Pence in Indiana, they are the opposite of what Jefferson wanted because they allow discrimination.
And at its core, discrimination is the result of fear.
Those who think Americans scare easily enough to abandon our country’s ideals in exchange for a false sense of security underestimate our resolve.
To them we say only this: Not here! Not ever!
Thank you!

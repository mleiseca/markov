Good evening, everyone. It is great to be here with all of you. My name is linda sanchez and i have the honor of representing california's 38 congressional district. And serving as the chairwoman of the congressional hispanic caucus. We are a diverse caucus and we bring an important perspective. We embody the promise of the american dream, that you can achieve success in our great country if you are willing to work hard enough for it. The hispanic caucus is made up of the six talented members who are veterans, attorneys, business owners, doctors, engineers. Our caucus is growing and this november, we have the opportunity to elect outstanding hispanic candidates from across the country. We will elect a latina to the u.s. Senate. I am proud of the hispanic caucus and the work we do every day to make our country stronger. Take a look.

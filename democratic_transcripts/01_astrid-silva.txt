When I was four years old, my mother and I climbed into a raft and we crossed the river to join my father in america. In search of a better life. All I had was a little doll. 

I grew up like an ordinary girl. My dad was a landscaper and my mom stayed at home. While my friends did ordinary things, I could not. Because my parents were afraid that someone might discover I was undocumented. My family believed so deeply in the promise of this country that we risked everything for the american dream. As an undocumented student, I felt like college was out of reach. After a journey of 10 years, I finally graduated from Nevada State College. 

My family and I are here because of people like senator harry reid. Mi abuelito who put themselves in our shoes and helped us. And while president obama's immigration act of protected me, we live in constant. That my parents could be taken away from their grandson. When donald trump talks about deporting 11 million people, he is talking about ripping families apart, separating families like mine and Carlos, hillary clinton understands that this is not who we are as a country. I have seen her comfort children like Carla who are scared that they might lose their parents to deportation. I know she will fight to keep our families together. Nuestra familia. I know she will.

Hello, sisters and brothers. I am Mary Kay Henry and I am proud to stand here on behalf of 2 million members of Service Employees International Union. And the millions more who are fighting for fifteen and a union. 

Our movement will be an unstoppable force in the election because the stakes could not be higher. 

We need a president who wants to raise wages in this country, not one that says wages are too high and there should not be a federal minimum wage. That is why we are working to elect hillary clinton and champions up and down the ballot who will raise wages and help workers joined together in unions. 

Hillary has spent time with workers who care for children and our seniors. Like Lisbeth O'neil from Las Vegas. Lisbeth has been a homecare provider for 40 years. But she has to rely on food stamps and medicaid just to make ends meet. Hillary clinton knows that is wrong and that is why hillary clinton is ready to raise wages for homecare providers and childcare providers and ensure they have a strong voice in quality care. 

We know economic justice is linked to winning racial justice, environmental justice and immigrant justice. We must elect hillary clinton and the champions like her were going to put families first and stop the candidate of hatred and greed. 

Brothers and sisters, i believe that we can win. Do you? Repeat after me. I believe that we can win!

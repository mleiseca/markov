I’m Congressman G.K. Butterfield from North Carolina.
In my community, you judge a man’s heart by his words and deeds.
Donald J. Trump, your words have been hostile. They have been bigoted and insulting.
You have used every opportunity to talk about your wealth, to denigrate people who don’t hold your views even within your own party.
You are not qualified to serve as president of the United States.
Instead of putting forth details to address income inequality and opportunity for everyday Americans, you use your celebrity status to paint a picture of gloom and doom.
You use your status to alienate African-American and other groups, and you would use the office of President to take our great nation in the wrong direction.
You want to know why your polling numbers are so dismal among African-Americans? I will tell you. We know – we know you have gotten rich through your business but we also know your wealth has come at the expense of other people.
We know, we know, we know you have no plan to address issues directly affecting African-American communities, such as gun violence and voting rights, historically black colleges and universities, raising the minimum wage and addressing persistent poverty.
Democrats want a better future for all of our people, for all of our families. Read our platform and compare it to the Republican platform.
Give us this chance. Give us this chance by electing Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine to lead our great country!

Welcome to philadelphia. The place where american independence began and where our constitution was born. Since the time of william penn, pennsylvania has been a commonwealth of creators and makers, builders who invent the future. My father, governor kasich believed that we must never forget that the sweat and blood of working men and women who built the winds -- pennsylvania for its the industrial revolution in our country and our produced the world. -- out produced the world. Over the years, the hillary clinton understands this. She will work every day to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. But what about donald trump? Donald says he stands for workers and he will put america first, but that is not how he has conducted himself in business. Where are his tremendous trump product made? Drescher, bangladesh. Furniture, turkey. At friends, india. Wineglasses, flaminia. Net ties, china. China. Why would donald trump make products in every corner of the world but not out to not, -- philadelphia? [cheering] this is what he says. Outsourcing is not always a terrible thing. Wages in america are too high. Then he complained about companies moving jobs overseas because we don't make things any more. Really? Tell that to the union workers at canonsburg to make pots and pans that in many of our kitchens. [cheering] tell that to the employees of hatfield who create toys that teach our children about engineering and architecture. Tell that to the robotic student at carnegie mellon were building 21st century robots and cars that drive themselves. [cheering] donald trump has not made anything except a book on the back of working people. If he is a champion of working people, on the starting center for the 76ers. [cheering] the man who once to make america great does not make anything in america. It is insulting that he has no plan, no plan to support the men and women were manufactured products here at home. All he has are empty promises like so many he has made and failed to follow through on big for -- before.if you believe that outsourcing has been good for working people, and has raised incomes for the middle class, then you should vote for donald trump. I'm putting for hillary clinton. [cheering] hillary believes we need an economy that works for everyone, not just donald trump and those at the top. We need to commit ourselves to making good paint jobs here at home so that everyone who works hard can stay there. That is when our first 100 days in office, president clinton will put forward the largest investment in good paint jobs since world war ii. -- paying jobs since world war ii. He will reward businesses that share profits with their employees. She will slap a new x attack -- exit tax that punishes countries that move overseas. He will strengthen the economy by investing $10 billion in new advanced manufacturing jobs that can't be sent overseas. This november, we have a choice. You can choose the candidate was only out for themselves, who want to get rid of the federal minimum wage and he would cut taxes for the richest americans at the expense of the middle class. Or you can choose hillary clinton, a leader with a proven track record of fighting for an economy that works for all of us. If you are for her like i am, sign up and volunteer at the clinton.com. -- hillaryclinton.com. Thank you. [cheering] ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to loot from chillicothe, ohio.

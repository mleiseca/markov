Good evening.
I wasn’t born in America, but I serve this great country every day.
As a Colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves, as a member of Congress, and as an immigrant whose parents chose this great nation, I care deeply about who serves as our commander-in-chief.
And I can’t wait until Jan. 20th when that person is Hillary Clinton.
But you don’t have to serve in Congress or serve in the military to demand that the person we entrust with the safety of our country, the lives of our troops, and the launch codes for our nuclear weapons has a steady hand.
All you have to be is a voter.
You know, the scariest part of Donald Trump’s acceptance speech wasn’t the apocalyptic America that he believes he sees. It’s that he said, “I alone can fix it.”
Every military commander I’ve ever met knows that you can’t do it alone, you can’t be brash, and you can’t make stuff up. Because when you ignore facts, people will die.
Hillary Clinton knows that each of us and all of our elements of national power make us stronger.
Smart diplomacy. A powerful economy. Educated children.
We are stronger together.
You know, Donald Trump said – and I am not making this up – “I know more about ISIS than the generals do.”
Well, please welcome to this stage the four star general who knows more about ISIS than anyone, the president’s former Special Envoy to the Global Coalition Against ISIS, retired Gen. John Allen.

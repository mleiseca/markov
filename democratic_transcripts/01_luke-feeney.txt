Hello, ohio! [cheering] i'm proud to serve the great people of historic chillicothe. Ohio's first capital. And i'm proud to be one of the many ohioans supporting hillary clinton. [cheering] when i think about the stake this november, i think about a woman from our hometown named courtney lewis. Her dad worked at the local paper mill. She did of opening her own bill for her and her city. She did not like the fancy building downtown. She wanted to do her part. So, she moved into a vacant storefront and with two partners, started a local gift shop. Three years later, it is a small towns or and it is not the only one. Chillicothe is on the rise. Appalachia is on the rise. It is thanks to small business owners like courtney. I tell courtney story tonight not because it is unique, but it is because it is not. All across the country, thousands of entrepreneurs and small business owners are equally ready to draw growth in the community, all they need is a chance. The last thing ohioans need is a president who has crushed small businesses by not paying them for the work they did. The last thing needs is donald trump. [cheering] hillary's dad was a small business owner. She gets it. Hillary knows that america works best when it works for everyone. And she has a plan. To make it entrepreneurs have all the tools they need to succeed. Less red tape, more active capital like bigger businesses have. A more even playing field. And a wider path to prosperity, for all of us. Mayors of small towns across the country needed president who will be a friend to small business, who will be a partner in our research and. Hillary knows american success stories start in places like chillicothe. That is why we are with her. That is why chillicothe is with her. That is why ohio is with her. [cheering] we are with her because she is with us. And that is why we're going to send hillary clinton to the white house this november. [cheering] thank you.

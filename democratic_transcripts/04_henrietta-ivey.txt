My name is Henrietta Ivey. I’m a Detroit home care worker. I’m a mother of four and a proud mother of seven grandchildren.
I am blessed to do work I believe in – keeping families in their homes and caring for people in need.
But even as I work my fingers to the bone, I don’t always feel the support I need from the leaders I’m supposed to trust.
I work two jobs at minimum wage and can barely make ends meet.
I remember looking at my babies’ faces when they were little and fighting back tears. Because I always taught them to dream big, but I didn’t always know if I would be able to live these dreams.
When I first met Hillary Clinton, we connected right away as mothers and as people who have led lives of service.
Because I know she will fight to raise the minimum wage.
In Michigan, we are fighting for 15! A $15 minimum wage and a union! Because no working American family should have to be forced to live in poverty!
I stand with Hillary Clinton because I see myself in her, and I believe she sees herself in me.
I believe her steady hand in the Oval Office will help people like me breathe easier and achieve more.
That makes this election bigger than politics. For me and all home care workers across the nation and my family, this is personal.
I know Hillary Clinton has our backs and we will have hers.
Thank you. Go out and vote Nov. 8th.
And God bless you all.

Hello, democrats. I am the president of the AFL CIO. 

It is great to be in philadelphia, a proud uniontown. Working people built this stage and will now build a new era of shared prosperity. Working people are strong and donald trump is wrong, wrong, wrong. 

Listen, he thinks he is a tough guy. Donald, i worked in the mines with tough guys. I know tough guys. Donald, you are no tough guy. You are a phony. 

Donald trump has repeatedly outsourced jobs to line his own pockets. He rooted for the housing collapse. He said wages are too high -- not just once, but repeatedly. Donald trump is not the solution to america's problems. He is the problem. 

Working people, we have the solution. We are building a movement for a better life, no matter the color of our skin, where we were born, for we love, or how we worship. 

Hillary clinton answered our call. She is fighting to rewrite the economic rules for all of us. She has a bold plan to invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and jobs. She opposes the job killing Transpacific Partnership. She will stand up to Wall Street and fight to finally secure equal pay for equal work. 

Democrats, get on your feet, change the rules. Let's elect hillary clinton the next president of the united states.

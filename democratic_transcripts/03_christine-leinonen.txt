It takes about 5 minutes for a church bell to ring 49 times. I know this because last month, my son Christopher, his boyfriend Juan, and 47 others were murdered at a club in Orlando.
Christopher was my only child. As I used to tell him, “You can’t do better than perfect.”
He had so many friends – two of whom are here tonight representing hundreds and hundreds more.
All his life, he brought people together. In high school, he won the Anne Frank Humanitarian Award for starting a gay-straight alliance.
Christopher’s paternal grandparents met and fell in love in a Japanese internment camp, so it was in his DNA that love always trumps hate.
Christopher – Christopher was a big Hillary supporter. That’s why I’m here.
So that I can tell you about the day that he was born. At the time, I was a Michigan state trooper. When I went into labor, the hospital put my off-duty gun in a safe. I didn’t argue; I know common sense gun policies save lives.
The weapon that murdered my son fires 30 rounds in one minute.
An Orlando city commissioner pointed out the terrible math – one minute for a gun to fire so many shots, five minutes for a bell to honor so many lives.
I’m glad common sense gun policy was in place the day Christopher was born. But where was that common sense the day he died?
I never want you to ask that question about your child. That’s why I support Hillary Clinton.

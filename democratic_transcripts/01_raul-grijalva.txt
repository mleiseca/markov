Good evening. I stand here in support of hillary clinton. 

On behalf of our future and in recognition of our proud past, i am reminded today of all the important fights of the past 50 years, fought and won by progressive leaders of our party. 

I came of age with Democrats who fought for civil rights,  for women's rights, for clean air, clean water, and for peace, and the many other great advancements made in this country that made it a better place. 

I came of age with a party that believed the public good, not the size of a donor's check, was the true measure of an idea. 

And, my friends, a new generation is coming of age today. Millions of young people, all ethnicities, all backgrounds, all income levels, are looking for us to stay true to the party's great ideals. 

They look to us hoping we will put their needs above those of the already rich and already powerful. Their idealism, their optimism, their belief in america, they are no different than the idealism that built this nation or the idealism that won progressive fights of a generation ago. 

Their idealism is just as powerful and, yes, just as fragile. In this election and in everything we do, we must remember that and be worthy of it. I would not be here today supporting our nominee if the democrats of 50 years had not had their courage. 

I would not be here if our party was built in the likes of donald trump who is trying to make our country meaner, hateful, more divided, and more fearful. 

I am proud to be part of a movement that is going to beat Donald trump. That is going to help elect hillary clinton. That is going to turn that idealism is a governing philosophy we should be proud of. 

Now it is time. Let's go win this. Let's win it for our people. And let's win it for our nation. Thank you.

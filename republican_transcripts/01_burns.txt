Hello, Republicans! I'm Pastor Mark Burns from the great state of South Carolina! I'm gonna pray and I'm gonna give the benediction. And you know why? Because we are electing a man in Donald Trump who believes in the name of Jesus Christ. And Republicans, we go to be united, because our enemy is not other Republicans, but is Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.

Let's pray together. Father God, in the name of Jesus, Lord, we're so thankful for the life of Donald Trump. We're thankful that you are guiding him, that you are giving him the words to unite this party, this country, that we together can defeat the liberal Democratic Party, to keep us divided not united. Because we are the United States of America, and we are the conservative party under God.

To defeat every attack that comes against us, protect the life of Donald Trump. Give him the words, give him the peace, give him the power and authority to be the next president of the United States of America. In Jesus' name. If you believe, shout "Amen!"

I’m honored to be an educator, to help the next generation of leaders, thinkers, builders, and entrepreneurs. Sadly, I’m part of a dwindling field.
I’ve seen too many good teachers come and go, mainly due to poor working conditions and little pay. Bad teachers get locked into the system and good teachers leave for more money.
On top of the bureaucratic challenges, what we’re teaching doesn’t always match what our students need.
To that end, I launched a STEM lab at my high school. These labs focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and help students learn proficiency in these fields.
We turn students away from education each year by not providing a robust curriculum that keeps up with the world in which these students live – and will eventually work.
And at the end of the day, all of what we do from the educators to the policy makers has to be student-focused and student-centered.
Students matter most.

In 2006, Anita and I had the pleasure of touring a Naval base in San Diego. Our guide that day happened to be a Navy SEAL recovering from combat- related injuries.
He was a Texas boy — plainspoken and respectful — and his love for America came through loud and clear. As we parted ways that day, we told him if you’re ever in Austin, come on by.
Now, some might call that meeting blind chance or a twist of fate, but I call it the grace of God. We kept in touch over the years through a tour in Iraq and his return to Texas until one day, he showed up on our doorstep unannounced with nowhere else to turn.
We welcomed him into our home, helped him get the care he needed and today, he’s like a second son. Many know about the battles he fought in Afghanistan, but few know about the battles that he and thousands of veterans like him face when they come home.
Tonight, our commitment is this: Making America great again starts by taking care of our veterans. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome an American hero. The Lone Survivor: Marcus Luttrell.
